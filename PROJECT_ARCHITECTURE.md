# Fleet Score Gamification Portal - Architecture & Progress

## Project Overview
A React-based Fleet Score Gamification portal that allows fleet managers to select goals and view personalized performance dashboards. This application helps fleet managers track their fleet's performance against specific objectives like safety, fuel efficiency, maintenance, and utilization.

## Architecture Details

### Frontend Structure
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
- **State Management**: React's useState and context API for component state
- **Routing**: Wouter for simple client-side routing

### Application Flow
1. Goal Selection Screen: User selects a primary goal (safety, fuel, maintenance, utilization)
2. Dashboard View: Displays personalized metrics based on the selected goal
   - Fleet score overview
   - Performance trends
   - Vehicle rankings
   - Recommendations based on goal

### Key Components
- **Core Application**
  - App.tsx: Main application entry point with routing
  - Main.tsx: React DOM initialization
  
- **Pages**
  - Home.tsx: Container for goal selection and dashboard screens
  - NotFound.tsx: Error page for invalid routes

- **UI Components**
  - GoalSelectionScreen: Interface for selecting fleet goals
  - DashboardScreen: Main dashboard container
  - Sidebar: Navigation sidebar with icons
  - FleetScoreCard: Displays overall fleet score
  - FleetScoreTrendCard: Shows score trend over time
  - VehiclePerformanceTable: Table of vehicle performance data
  - PerformersCard: Shows top/bottom performers
  - RecommendationsCard: Goal-specific recommendations

### Data Model
- Goal: 'safety' | 'fuel' | 'maintenance' | 'utilization'
- Vehicle: Vehicle record with performance metrics
- Recommendation: Actionable insights for fleet improvement
- GoalData: Goal-specific metrics and recommendations
